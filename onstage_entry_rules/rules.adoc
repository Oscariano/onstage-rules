[[judging-overview]]
== Judging Overview

All teams are judged in the following areas: Poster, Interview and the Performance. Teams must highlight three of their robot(s) *features* in the work they present to the judges. Ask the following question - “What do we think took us the most time to prepare for the performance.

Teams should describe their three chosen features in the Poster, before being judged on the implementation of these features during the Performance. In addition, teams should demonstrate their understanding of their systems in the Technical Interview.

For clarification on a teams’ features, please do not hesitate to reach out to the OnStage League committee using the RoboCupJunior Forum.

[[general]]
== General

It is the responsibility of the participating team(s) and regional representatives to verify the participants' eligibility requirements, which are as follows:

[[team-size-membership]]
=== Team Size & Membership

Each team must have *2 to 6 members*. Each team member needs to carry a role within the team. Each participant can join only one team. No members can, be shared between teams and/or leagues.

[[age-requirement]]
=== Age requirement

All team members must be below the age of 14 years (ages as of 1st of July). Older participants are not allowed to take part in the entry league.

[[onstage-performance]]
== OnStage Performance (50% of total score)

The OnStage Performance is an opportunity to demonstrate the robot(s) through a performance or stage show. 

Teams will present a live performance, in which their routine will be judged.

Teams are encouraged to be as creative and entertaining as they can.
 
[[stage-performance]]
=== Stage performance

Teams have at least to two opportunities to perform before the judges.

The duration of the performance routine must be no less than 1:00 minute.

Each team has a total of seven minutes on the stage. This time includes stage set-up, introduction, performance routine and the time for clearing the stage.

Teams wait on the side of the stage before being welcomed on stage.

Teams are strongly encouraged to use the time while they are setting up on the stage to introduce to the audience the performance and the features of their robots.

[[restarts]]
=== Restarts

Teams can restart their routine if necessary.

The team must leave the stage after their time on stage has expired.

[[music-and-multimedia-presentations]]
=== Music and Multimedia presentations

Teams may use music or video to complement their performance.

If a team uses copyrighted music, they should follow the Copyright Law of the region where the event is held. 

Teams are encouraged to provide a video or slideshow as part of their performance.

[[Stage]]
=== Stage

The size of the performance stage area is a rectangular area of 5 x 4 meters (m) for robots with the 5 meter side facing the judges.

The floor provided shall be made of a flat (non-glossy) white surface, for example, painted MDF (compressed wood fiber). While floor joints will be made to be as smooth as possible, robots must be prepared for irregularities of up to 5 mm in the floor surface. Whilst every effort will be made to make the stage flat, this may not be possible, and teams should be prepared to cope with this uncertainty.

[[robots]]
=== Robots

Robots must perform autonomously.

Teams should construct their own robot rather than using the instructions that come with a commercial kit.

Teams are encouraged to design costumes for their robot. If a team wants to use a famous character as their robot, the team should pay attention to the copyright of the character.

[[communication-and-localization]]
=== Communication and Localization

Robots are encouraged to communicate with each other during the performance. Suggested and allowed communication protocols are infrared (IR), Bluetooth (LE and classic), ZigBee, RFID or other localization platforms.

There must be no communication between off-stage and on-stage devices.

[[scenery]]
=== Scenery

Props are encouraged and can be used to add value to the performance.

Robots can sense static props to perform a certain task or trigger an action.

[[robot-autonomy-and-interaction]]
=== Robot Autonomy and Interaction

Robots may be started manually at the beginning of the performance.

During the performance, remote control of a robot is prohibited.

Interaction between robots and/or humans may be used to dynamically alter the robot's behavior. Robots that interact with their environment and respond accordingly will be highly rewarded.

[[humans-on-stage]]
=== Humans on stage

Human team members may perform with their robots on the stage during the performance. They should make sure not to hide important components of their robot performance from the judges/audience.

Humans may use the stage area to illustrate the robots movements through acting.

[[preparations-for-the-stage-performance]]
=== Preprarations for the stage performance

It is the responsibility of the team to ensure that the music and video/presentation is playing correctly before their first performance by liaising with the RoboCupJunior OnStage officials.

[[saftety-and-power-considerations]]
=== Safety and Power Considerations

Under no circumstances can *mains electricity* be used during the performance. Every robot should be equipped with some sort of battery power, with a maximum of 15 volts. 

Lithium batteries must be transported or moved in safety bags. 

Participants should design their robot(s) to be a size that they can easily carry by themselves. Robots should be of a weight that team members can carry and lift onto the stage with ease.

To protect participants and comply with occupational health and safety regulations, routines may not include anything that could be considered a projectile, explosions, smoke, or flame, use of water, or any other hazardous substances (contact the committee through the forum when in doubt).

[[onstage-interview]]
== OnStage Interview (30% of total score)

The Technical Interview is a live interview between the team and the judges, in which all robots and programming are judged against technical criteria. Judges are interested in determining students' understanding of the robots they have used.

[[interview-procedure]]

All teams will have up to 15 minutes of technical interview judging during the competition. Which will take place as an in-person meeting with the judges in a separate room at the venue.

Teams should have *all* robots present at the interview.

Teams should bring copies of their programm code.

If the judges consider it necessary, teams may be asked to complete a second interview.

[[translator]]
=== Translator

The Technical Interviews take place in the main language of the event. If teams require a translator, they should inform the RoboCupJunior OnStage officials prior to the event to allow translators to be organized.

Extra time will not be given for teams with a translator.

[[onstage-poster]]
== OnStage Poster (20% of total score)

Each team is required to bring a Poster. The purpose of the poster is to explain the technology used, as well as to showcase the robots’ software and hardware.

The size of the poster should be no larger than A1 (60 x 84 cm).

Areas that are useful to be included in the poster are:

- team name and region
- performance description
- annotated pictures of the development process

Teams will be given public space to display their Technical Poster.
